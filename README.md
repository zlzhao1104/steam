*STEAM* (Space-Time Environment for Analysis of Mobility) is developed to visualize dynamic stay/move activities.  It is very useful in demonstrating how humans, animals, vehicles, or other types of object, move in space over time, based on animation-based interactive visualization.  The following video is a demo of its application in studying urban dynamics using mobile phone location data (make sure to enable “HD” on the bottom-right corner).

This release includes the core function: visualizing (temporal) OD flows using flowing points.  Other functions demonstrated in the demo video, such as interactively query functions, will be released in the future.

*STEAM* is developed based on *Processing* (https://processing.org), a Java-based programming language for art and visual design.  *STEAM* also relies on a *Processing* library, *MapThing* (http://www.reades.com/2013/04/01/the-mapthing-processing-library/#more-), for geovisualization capabilities, such as support for *Esri* Shapefile.
